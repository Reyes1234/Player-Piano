# Player Piano
Program to read a player-piano-esque input and
write out the notes to be played, with the correct timing!
Notes need to play A-G in addition to flats and sharps (no octaves)
[A, Ab, A#, Bb, B, Cb,  C, C#, D, Db, D#, E, Eb, Fb, F, F#, G)

Each note should also say when it is to start playing and
for how long it should be played (seconds)

Needs to print out a direction when each note is to start playing
and when it ends

Output should be order chronologically

Needs a loop for sure, function, variables,
